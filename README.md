## General Diagram

1. identify the object - hypothesis - ok
2. identify the information i am going to use 
3. identify the steps to merge the data
4. identify the technique to show the result
5. identify the way to apply the insight found
6. collect the datasets
7. clean the datasets
8. creating the business rules based in steps to merge
9. show the result based in the technique 
10. apply the changes

## topic : energy (replace fossil fuel by hydrogen)
## hypothesis: deploy machine with hydrogen in places will
### generate better lives styles and it is an opportunity to fight 
### against the corruptions
## information: 
## energy world data - https://ourworldindata.org
1. Who is the client, what business domain is the client in?
   - the client should be my father because he has the product, but my fathers client
     - should be every place without easy accessing to energy
   - the goverment, they buy energy
     - 
2. What business problem are we trying to address?
   - expensive energy in poor places
     - places without energy access (data)
     - country and energy types 
   - real situation where the energy does not exist
     - what the people do when they dont have energy
   - generate our own energy
     - current energy sources
   - pollution and dirty energy
     - quantity of pollution
3. How is it going to be consumed by the customer?
   - we will be able to prepare a better strategy to deploy the hydrogen generator
4. What is the economic impact of this project?
   - places without easy access to energy will be able to :
     - cook, get warm, warm shower, live better
   - people break the government dependency in term of energy
5. What type of decisions will our data science feature drive?
   - quantity of pollution beetween hydrogen vs fuel fossil
   - how many people will change their live or life style
   - 
6. What metric will we use to call this project a success and how will we measure it?
   - how many people is getting a better life style
   - how much energy we can sell to the goverment
